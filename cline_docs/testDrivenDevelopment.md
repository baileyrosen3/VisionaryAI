# Test-Driven Development (TDD) Approach: VisionaryAI

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)

**Status:** Draft - To be elaborated as testing implementation begins.

## 1. Testing Strategy Overview

VisionaryAI will employ a pragmatic approach to testing, focusing on ensuring core functionality, component integrity, and reliable integration with backend services and external APIs. While strict TDD (writing tests before code) might not be applied universally, tests will be written concurrently with development to validate features and prevent regressions.

## 2. Testing Tools & Frameworks

- **Frontend (React):**
    - **Unit/Component Testing:** Vitest ([https://vitest.dev/](https://vitest.dev/)) - A Vite-native testing framework compatible with Jest API.
    - **Testing Library:** React Testing Library ([https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)) - For testing components from the user's perspective.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing (Optional/Future):** Playwright or Cypress.
- **Backend (Supabase Edge Functions - Deno/TypeScript):**
    - **Unit Testing:** Deno's built-in test runner (`deno test`). Standard library assertions (`@std/assert`).
    - **Mocking:** Potential use of mocking libraries compatible with Deno if needed for isolating external API calls (e.g., Replicate AI).

## 3. Frontend Testing Approach

- **Component Tests:** Focus on rendering components correctly based on props, handling user interactions (clicks, inputs), and verifying state changes within the component's scope. Use React Testing Library to interact with components like a user would.
- **Integration Tests (Frontend):** Test the interaction between multiple components, context providers, and basic data flow within the frontend application.
- **Supabase Client Interaction:** Mock Supabase client calls during component/integration tests to isolate frontend logic.

## 4. Backend Testing Approach (Edge Functions)

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual helper functions and business logic within the Edge Function, mocking external dependencies (like `fetch` calls to Replicate AI or Supabase client interactions).
- **Integration Tests (Edge Function Scope):** Test the main handler function, potentially using mock request/response objects to simulate incoming requests and verify the overall output, including interactions with mocked external services.
- **Focus Areas:** Input validation, correct API call formation to Replicate AI, response handling (success/error), data transformation.

## 5. Integration Testing (Full System - Future)

- E2E tests simulating user flows from the frontend through the Edge Function and back, potentially interacting with a staging/test Supabase environment and potentially mocked AI responses.

## 6. Test Execution

- Tests should be runnable locally via `npm test` (frontend) and `deno test` (backend).
- Integration into CI/CD pipeline (when set up) to run tests automatically on commits/pull requests.
