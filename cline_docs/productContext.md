# Product Context: VisionaryAI

## Why This Project Exists

To provide users with a powerful tool to visualize their goals and dreams, making them feel more attainable and real.

## What Problems It Solves

- Difficulty in visualizing abstract goals and future aspirations.
- Lack of personalized and immersive tools for manifestation and goal setting.
- Bridging the gap between imagination and a tangible representation of success.

## How It Should Work (High-Level)

1.  **User Input:** Users upload a clear picture of their face and describe their goals/visions (text input).
2.  **Media Selection:** The system (or user) selects relevant background images/videos representing the described goals (e.g., a picture of a dream house, a video of a target travel destination).
3.  **AI Processing:** An AI model performs face-swapping or deepfake-style integration, placing the user's face realistically onto the selected media.
4.  **Audio Generation:** An AI model potentially generates or integrates a relevant audio story or affirmation related to the goal.
5.  **Output:** The user receives a personalized video or image sequence showing "themselves" achieving their vision, accompanied by audio.
6.  **Goal:** Help users internalize and believe in the possibility of achieving their dreams through vivid visualization.
