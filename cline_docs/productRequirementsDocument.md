# Product Requirements Document (PRD): VisionaryAI

**Version:** 0.1 (Initial Draft)

**Status:** Draft - Requires further elaboration and user feedback.

## 1. Introduction

VisionaryAI aims to help users visualize their goals by transforming an uploaded image and a textual description of their desired future state into a new, AI-generated image representing that future.

## 2. Goals

- Provide users with a simple interface to upload an image and describe their goal.
- Utilize AI image generation to create a compelling visualization of the user's described future state, based on their input image.
- Offer a clear and inspiring way for users to connect with their aspirations.

## 3. User Stories (Initial - High Level)

- **As a user, I want to** upload a starting image (e.g., a picture of myself, my current home, my workspace).
- **As a user, I want to** provide a text description of my goal or desired future state related to the image (e.g., "me looking confident after achieving fitness goal", "my home renovated with a modern kitchen", "my workspace organized and productive").
- **As a user, I want to** submit my image and text description to the application.
- **As a user, I want to** see an AI-generated image that visually represents the future state I described, based on my original image.
- **As a user, I want to** be able to easily view or potentially download the generated visualization.

## 4. Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)

- **Image Upload:**
    - Interface element to select and upload an image file (e.g., JPG, PNG).
    - Basic validation (file type, size limits TBD).
- **Goal Input:**
    - Text area for users to input their goal description.
    - Character limit TBD.
- **Visualization Request:**
    - Button to trigger the visualization process.
    - Frontend sends image (or its URL after upload) and text description to the backend (Edge Function).
- **Visualization Display:**
    - Area to display the AI-generated image returned from the backend.
    - Loading indicator while the image is being generated.
    - Basic error handling display (e.g., if generation fails).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements (Initial Thoughts)

- **Performance:** Image generation time should be reasonable (acknowledging AI processing time). Target TBD.
- **Usability:** Simple, intuitive interface.
- **Scalability:** Initial focus on MVP, but architecture should allow for future scaling (handled largely by Supabase/Replicate).
- **Security:** Protect user uploads and potentially sensitive goal descriptions. Secure API keys.

## 6. Future Considerations (Post-MVP)

- User accounts and saving visualizations.
- More advanced image editing/prompting options.
- Different AI models or styles.
- Sharing capabilities.
- Mobile application.
